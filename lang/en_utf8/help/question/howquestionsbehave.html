<h1>How questions behave</h1>

<p>Students can interact with the questions in the quiz in various different ways.
For example, you may wish the students to enter an answer to each question
and then submit the entire quiz, before anything is graded or they get any feedback.
That would be 'Deferred feedback' mode.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you may wish for students to submit each question as they go
along to get immediate feedback, and if they do not get it right immediately,
have another try for less marks. That would be 'Interactive with multiple tries' mode.</p>

<p>Those are probably the two most commonly used modes of behaviour. To learn
what the other modes to, why not try them out.</p>
