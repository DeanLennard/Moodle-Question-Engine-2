<h1>Penalty for each incorrect try</h1>

<p>When you run your questions using the 'Interactive with multiple tries' or
'Adaptive mode' behaviour, so that the the student will have several tries to
get the question right, then this option controls how much they are penalised
for each incorrect try.</p>

<p>The penalty is a proportion of the total question grade, so if the question
is worth three marks, and the penalty is 0.3333333, then the student will
score 3 if they get the question right first time, 2 if they get it right
second try, and 1 of they get it right on the third try.</p>
