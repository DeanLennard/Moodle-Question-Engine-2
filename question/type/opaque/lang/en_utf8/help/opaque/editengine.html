<h2>Editing Opaque question engine configuration</h2>

<p>This form lets you edit the configuration of an
<a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:Opaque" target="_blank">Opaque</a>
question engine.</p>

<p>Each remote system you configure must have a name, which will be used to 
identify it within Moodle.</p>

<p>You must specify at least one question engine URL.</p>

<p>You can also specify question bank URLs, if your remote question engine uses a separate question bank.</p>

<p>When specifying URLs, you may specify several, one per line. Do this when you
have several load-balanced servers. Calls to the question engines will be distributed 
approximately evenly over the different remote servers.</p>
