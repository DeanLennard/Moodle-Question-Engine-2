<h2>Opaque question type</h2>

<p><a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:Opaque" target="_blank">Opaque</a>
is a way of connecting other compatible question engines into Moodle. 
This screen lets you create an Opaque question by identifying which
remote question engine to connect to, and giving the identity of the question on that
remote engine, as explained in the Opaque documentation. Question engines need to be
configured on the question engine configuration admin screen.</p>
