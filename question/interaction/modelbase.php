     * finish => 1, and manual comment/grade becomes an action with im vars
     * comment => comment text, and mark => ..., max_mark => ... if the question
     * is graded.
     *
     * This method should first determine whether the action is significant. For
     * example, if no actual action is being performed, but instead the current
     * responses are being saved, and there has been no change since the last
     * set of responses that were saved, this the action is not significatn. In

     * Otherwise it should return {@link question_attempt::KEEP}.

     * necessary updates to $pendingstep. For example, it should call
     * {@link question_attempt_step::set_state()} to set the state that results
     * from this action, and if this is a grading action, it should call
     * {@link question_attempt_step::set_fraction()}.

     * This method can also call {@link question_attempt_step::set_im_var()} to
     * store additional infomation. There are two main uses for this. This can
     * be used to store the result of any randomisation done. It is important to
     * store the result of randomisation once, and then in future use the same
     * outcome if the actions are ever replayed. This is how regrading works.
     * The other use is to cache the result of expensive computations performed
     * on the raw response data, so that subsequent display and review of the
     * question does not have to repeat the same expensive computations.
     *
     * Often this method is implemented as a dispatching method that examines
     * the pending step to determine the kind of action being performed, and
     * then calls a more specific method like {@link process_save()} or
     * {@link process_comment()}. Look at some of the standard interaction
