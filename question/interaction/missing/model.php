/**
 * Fake question interaction model that is used when the actual interaction
 * model is not available.
 *
 * Imagine, for example, that a quiz attempt has been restored from another
 * Moodle site with more interaction models installed, or an interaction model
 * that used to be available in this site has been uninstalled. Obviously all we
 * can do is have some code to prevent fatal errors.
 *
 * The approach we take is: The rendering code is still implemented, as far as
 * possible. A warning is shown that interaction-model specific bits may be missing.
 * Any attempt to process anything causes an exception to be thrown.
